# Project Context: vyvee.github.io

## Overview
This directory contains the source code for a personal website hosted on GitHub Pages (`vyvee.github.io`). It serves as a hub for various utilities, guides, and educational resources created by the author, with a strong focus on mathematics and technical tutorials.

The site is built using static HTML and CSS, designed to be lightweight and responsive.

## Directory Structure & Key Files

### Root Directory
*   **`index.html`**: The main entry point (Homepage). It lists available resources and links to other pages.
*   **`maths-cache.html`**: The landing page for "Maths Cache" (数学秘籍), a project providing mathematics notes and tools. It links to the Google Play Store (Android) and a Web App version.
*   **`screen-recording-ffmpeg.html`**: A comprehensive guide on using FFmpeg for screen recording on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
*   **`maths-cheatsheets.html`**: A page dedicated to listing and providing access to PDF mathematics cheatsheets.
*   **`kuala_lumpur_sunrise_sunset.html`**: A utility page displaying sunrise and sunset times.

### Subdirectories
*   **`cheatsheets/`**: Contains PDF files serving as mathematics reference materials (e.g., integration strategies).
*   **`mathscache/`**: Contains assets and sub-pages related specifically to the Maths Cache project, such as privacy policies and logos.

## Key Projects

### Maths Cache (数学秘籍)
A collection of efficient maths notes and tools.
*   **Platform:** Android (Google Play) and Web App.
*   **Files:** `maths-cache.html`, `mathscache/` directory.

### Technical Guides
Tutorials and cheat sheets for technical tasks.
*   **Example:** `screen-recording-ffmpeg.html` provides low-resource screen recording commands for proctoring.

## Development & Usage

### Editing
*   The project consists of standard static HTML files.
*   Styles are generally embedded within the `<style>` tags in the `<head>` of each document, sharing a consistent visual theme (e.g., "OldLace" background `#fdf5e6`).
*   Images are stored in the root or specific subdirectories.

### Deployment
*   As a GitHub Pages repository, changes pushed to the `main` (or `master`) branch are automatically deployed to `https://vyvee.github.io/`.
